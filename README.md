![labyrinth_banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7a4b07-9233-4cf6-a894-e336f8174adc)

Labyrinth is a project that lets you visualise graph search algorithms and learn about them in a fun and visual way.

Currently it supports these algorithms:

-   Breadth-first search
-   Depth-first search
-   Dijkstra's algorithm

Planned improvements:

-   More algorithms!
    -   A\* search
    -   Bidirectional swarm
    -   Convergent swarm
-   Better maze generation
-   Mobile support

## Setup

This project is built with Vite. To run it yourself, follow the below steps.
