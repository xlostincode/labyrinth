### Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Depth-First Search**‚Äîor just **DFS**‚Äîis like the adventurous sibling of BFS. Instead of carefully exploring all paths evenly, DFS is the kind of algorithm that picks a path and dives straight in, only backtracking when it hits a dead end.

### Let‚Äôs break it down with a fun example

Imagine you‚Äôre an explorer in a massive underground cave system. You start at the entrance, and your goal is to find a hidden treasure deep inside.

What do you do?

Instead of checking every tunnel entrance before going deeper (like BFS would), you pick **one tunnel** and follow it as far as you can. You keep moving forward, turning wherever necessary, until you either **find the treasure** or **reach a dead end**.

If you **hit a dead end**, you don‚Äôt panic! You simply **backtrack** to the last junction where you had another unexplored tunnel, and you try that one next.

Eventually, one of two things will happen:

1. üéâ You find the treasure‚Äîmission accomplished!
2. ‚ùå You‚Äôve backtracked all the way to the entrance and there are no more tunnels left to explore. In that case, you know the treasure **doesn't exist** in this cave system.

### Fun facts

-   The name **Depth-First Search** comes from the fact that the algorithm explores **deep** into a path before coming back up to check other paths.
-   Unlike BFS (which explores evenly), DFS is more like a **curious adventurer** that follows its instincts.
-   DFS is often used for **maze generation**, **solving puzzles like Sudoku**, and even **navigating AI decision trees** in games.

Notice how the visualization resembles a snake slithering through the maze, unlike BFS, which spreads like a flood. This happens because DFS focuses on a single path, only backtracking when needed.

### Let‚Äôs talk about code

```
Depth_First_Search(Graph, StartNode):
    // Push our starting point (StartNode) onto the stack.
    Stack.push( StartNode )

    // Mark StartNode as `visited`
    mark StartNode as visited.

    while ( Stack is not empty )
        // Remove the top node from the stack
        V = Stack.pop( )

        // Go through all the neighbors of V
        for all neighbours neighbour_of_V of V in Graph

            // If we haven't visited this neighbor yet
            if neighbour_of_V is not visited

                // Push it onto the stack and mark as visited
                Stack.push( neighbour_of_V )
                mark neighbour_of_V as visited.
```

Note: Just like with BFS, you'd typically use a Set or Map to track visited nodes, but we‚Äôve omitted that for simplicity.

### That's it!

No magic, no fancy tricks‚Äîjust **pick a path, go deep, and backtrack if needed**. DFS is like a **determined adventurer**‚Äîalways going forward until there's no other choice but to turn back. üöÄ
